Selenium Class 7

Handling multiple windows (tabs):
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

the original page where you navigate will be called parent handle
and additional tab opened afterwards will be called child handle

Most of the time when you interact with links they will open a new tab or a window

what is Synchronization:
is the process bringing the speed of two or more components to the same level
in this case we are bringing our script and page load to the same speed level

Threat.sleep() ---- static wait / unconditional wait
Types of selenium waite
We have 3 Types of selenium waite
1) Implicit waits:
2) Explicit waits:
3) Fluent waits:

what is Implicit wait:
it tell the webdriver to wait until certian amount of time before throwing an exception
it will only be written once  and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
we can say the Implicit wait is a gloabl wait

Implicit wait work with findelements() method
Implicit wait is usually set for 20 seconds. if your element is found in any time between the given time the remaning time will be
ingnored and you script will move on to the next line or to the next step

if the element is not found in a given time, only then you will get an exception
